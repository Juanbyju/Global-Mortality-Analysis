Global Mortality Analysis (2015-2019)

## Project Overview
Understanding the leading causes of death worldwide provides critical insights into public health priorities, resource allocation, and intervention strategies. This project examines global mortality trends from 2015 to 2019, focusing on key causes such as:
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Nutritional deficiencies
- Substance abuse
- Conflict-related deaths

These causes were chosen for their global relevance and significant impact on various populations. The purpose of our visualizations is to identify patterns, correlations, and trends in mortality data, enabling a deeper understanding of health challenges and disparities across regions and countries.
